    <h1>SEA Scenery</h1>
    <p>The sea, or ocean, is a vast body of saltwater that covers approximately 71% of the Earth's surface. It is an essential part of Earth's ecosystem, playing a vital role in regulating the planet's climate, supporting marine life, and providing resources. The sea is home to a diverse array of creatures, from microscopic plankton to massive whales, and serves as a habitat for numerous species. <br><br>

        Seas vary in size and can be classified as large, such as the Mediterranean or Caribbean, or smaller, like the Red Sea or Baltic Sea. The sea's water is salty due to the dissolution of minerals from the Earth's crust, primarily sodium chloride. It is constantly in motion, with waves, tides, and currents influenced by factors such as the moon's gravity, wind, and Earth's rotation. <br><br>
        
        The sea is a key component of the water cycle, with evaporation, precipitation, and runoff from land contributing to its water levels. Additionally, the ocean is important for transportation, trade, and recreation, providing people with activities like swimming, fishing, and boating. Its beauty, mystery, and importance in sustaining life make the sea one of Earth's most remarkable and valuable resources.</p>
